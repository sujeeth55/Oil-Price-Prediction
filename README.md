1. Project Goal: 
Developing accurate and reliable models for predicting future crude oil prices (e.g., Brent, WTI).
Providing insights for decision-making in areas such as energy policy, investment strategies, and trading.

2. Dataset:
Utilization of historical data on crude oil prices, potentially including various economic and market indicators (e.g., supply/demand figures, geopolitical events, financial market data).

3. Forecasting Techniques: 
Implementation of a range of time series forecasting techniques, such as:
Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA).
Machine learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and other deep learning architectures.
Ensemble models combining multiple techniques for improved accuracy.

4. Tools and Libraries:
Common libraries and tools used in these projects include:
Python (e.g., Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation).
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning models.
Keras, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for deep learning models.
Statsmodels for statistical modeling.

5. Evaluation Metrics:
Assessment of model performance using metrics like:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
R-squared (R2) score.
